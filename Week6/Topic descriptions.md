### Bootstrap
A bootstrap, a term first coined during the 1950s, is a program that initializes the operating system (OS) during startup. The term was said to be derived from the expression “pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps,” starting small and loading programs one at a time while each program is “laced” or connected to the next program to be executed in sequence. This is, in essence, exactly what Bootstrap does for web development.

Bootstrap provides a fully comprehensive suite of tools and pre-built CSS classes that allow anyone to quickly develop and deploy a responsive, highly professional web page. It also provides an easy to understand system through which a user can build a website that responds to different screen sizes, removing the need for a separate mobile site.

## JavaScript
### jQuery
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Using only the magical '$' selector, any JavaScript programmer's life is made faster and easier as jQuery condenses what would have been a long, complicated line of code into short, easy to read jQuery. jQuery makes JavaScript easy to command and easier to master.

## Ruby
### C.R.U.D
Standing for Create, Read, Update and Destroy the CRUD framework can be used in any application built to do these four things. For instance a blogging site, such as Tumblr, can add, view, edit and delete posts. The CRUD framework requires a database in which to store these changes. This often takes the form of a SQL server.

### SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce after learning about the relational model from Ted Codd[15] in the early 1970s. This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasi-relational database management system, System R. Nowadays, after many changes and versions SQL is the go-to language for any developer in need of a database.

SQL comes in several different forms thanks to the management systems available from various companies. These including MySQL, Azure and PostgreSQL, each providing its own flavour of user interface and a unique SQL experience.

### RESTful Routing
Managing routes yourself can be cumbersome, frustrating, and unproductive. Some developers utilize a catch-all route, which may lead to unexpected problems as the application grows. REST (Representational State Transfer) solves routing management issues by providing an opinionated interface of registering routes.

The aim of all this is to keep the developer concious of his/her controllers by keeping all controllers limited to the Seven Golden Actions: INDEX, SHOW, CREATE, NEW, EDIT, UPDATE, DESTORY. With these actions a developer can create a theoretically limitless website, subject only to th limits of their database.

### Sinatra
Sinatra is a DSL (domain specific language) for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort. Sinatra makes use of the REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture style (sometimes referred to as RESTful routing). It provides various shortcuts and functionality to facilitate quick and easy web development.

### Rails
Ruby on Rails is a difficult beast to comprehend. Like Sinatra it attempts to make the life of a developer easier by providing shortcuts through the common issues of the REST (Representational Stat Transfer) architecture style. Rails is like Sinatra on speed - it does everything for you, even if it shouldn't because it is capabale of identifying and recitifying common mistakes at compile time.

Using Rails and its built in functionality a user can have a basic website spun up in minutes thanks to the vast scope of its software architechture, which can interpret HTML, Ruby, SQL and YML.

In order to fully utilise the Rails system, a developer must conform to certain file and folder naming conventions. Conflicts can emerge if the developer does not first familiarise himself with these conventions.
